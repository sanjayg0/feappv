# feappv
FEAPpv -- free personal version of the FEAP (A Finite Element Analysis Program)

This version of FEAP is available for free.  It is directly modeled after FEAP but does not contain all of its features, such as a
parallel capability, contact and a number of other advanced features, but newly it provies fe2, igafeap.  Its architecture is generally similar to FEAP's but often is a bit behind in programming style.  Some additional details can be found at http://projects.ce.berkeley.edu/feap/feappv.

For information on FEAP see http://projects.ce.berkeley.edu/feap

There is a FEAP and FEAPpv forum at http://feap.berkeley.edu and there is a nacent wiki at http://feap.berkeley.edu/wiki
